## Purpose
The main purpose of this challenge is to create a set of visualizations using Tableau to show the information about the Citibike business in NYC. With this challenge, we can convince our investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business.
## Results

#### Top Starting Location: 
From the results, we can analyze that the top location had a total of 16,564 users in one month. 
#### Checkout Times for Users: 
146,752 total users used the CitiBike program for only 5 minutes per trip. Followed by 145,147 users, whose trip duration was only 6 minutes.
#### Checkout Times by Gender: 
Male users have the highest usage for the CitiBike program (108,087 users for a 5-minute trip), which is 3 times more than female users. 
#### Trips by Weekday per hour: 
The busiest time recorded for this program is 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM on Thursdays, with a total of 88,887 users. While 02:00 AM to 04:00 AM is the least busy time of the week.
#### Trips by Gender (Weekday per hour):
In this category we can analyze that pattern of the number of Male and Female users during the weekday is same as the previous category. While Unknown users have their highest usage from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Saturdays.
#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday: 
Male subscribers had the highest usage of the program than any other category. Which is the highest, at 259,316 on Thursdays, and lowest at 131,205 on Sundays.
#### Top Ending Location: 
As the top starting location, the same location was recorded as the top Ending location for this program with a number of 16,455 usages during the given period.
## Summary 
To summarize, the CitiBike program is a great business in NYC and can be considered to start a similar program in Des Moines. From the analysis, we can see that males have the highest numbers of users in all categories. The time of 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM was the least busy and this can be used for the maintenance of the bikes. In the last, I want to suggest two additional visualizations for this project. First, to get the cost of maintenance for the bikes each month and, how often the maintenance is required for the bikes. These can be used to impress our investors in a better way with real figures from a program already working successfully.
